# QPAD_Projects

A collection of small projects built for the **QPAD** — a touch-pad driven microcontroller platform with a compact display.

This repository serves as a home for experiments, games, and other creative firmware projects targeting the QPAD. Each project lives in its own folder and documents itself.
