# 🎮🕹️ QPAD_Games

A collection of small game projects built for the **QPAD** platform 🧩🔥

This folder contains playable experiments, arcade-style builds, and other interactive firmware created for QPAD.  
Each game lives in its own folder and documents itself independently 📂📖

These projects explore gameplay, UI design, creative constraints, and just enough chaos to make things fun 😈✨

---

## 📦 Structure

Each subfolder:

- 🗂️ Is a standalone game project  
- 🧠 Contains its own sketch / firmware  
- 📖 Includes its own README (when applicable)  

Fork them. Break them. Improve them. Compete with yourself 🏆💥

## Thanks 🙌💛

Huge thanks to **Quentin Bolsee**, creator of the QPAD, for designing and sharing this awesome platform and making projects like these possible.
