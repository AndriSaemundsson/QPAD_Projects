# 📱✨ QPAD_Apps

A collection of small application-style projects built for the **QPAD** platform 🧩⚡

This folder contains utilities, experiments, tools, and other non-game firmware projects created for QPAD.  
Each app lives in its own folder and includes its own documentation and source files 📂📝

The goal of this collection is to explore what small, focused applications can look like on a compact embedded platform — simple ideas, thoughtfully executed 💡🛠️

## 📦 Structure

Each subfolder:

- 🗂️ Is a standalone project  
- 🧠 Contains its own sketch / firmware  
- 📖 Includes its own README (when applicable)  

Feel free to explore, remix, extend, or break things (on purpose) 🔬🚀
